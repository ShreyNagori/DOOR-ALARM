Project Title: Door Buzzer Alarm with Ultrasonic Sensor

Objective: The goal of this project is to design a door buzzer alarm system that uses an Arduino microcontroller and an Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) to detect the presence of someone at the door. 
The system will alert the homeowner with a buzzer sound whenever someone is at the door.

Components:
Arduino Uno
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
Piezo Buzzer
Jumper Wires
Breadboard
Functionality:

The Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) will be used to measure the distance from the door to the sensor. 
When the distance is below a certain threshold, it will trigger the piezo buzzer to sound an alarm. 
The buzzer will continue to sound until the distance goes back above the threshold, indicating that the person has left the door. 
The Arduino Uno will be used to control the Ultrasonic Sensor and the piezo buzzer.

Setup:
Connect the Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) to the Arduino board.
Connect the piezo buzzer to the Arduino board.
Connect the jumper wires to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board, Ultrasonic Sensor, and piezo buzzer.
Upload the code to the Arduino board.

Code:
The code for the door buzzer alarm will be written in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 
The code will use the libraries for the Ultrasonic Sensor and the piezo buzzer to measure the distance and sound the alarm. 
The code will include conditional statements to ensure that the buzzer only sounds when someone is at the door.

Conclusion:
The door buzzer alarm system using an Arduino and an Ultrasonic Sensor is a more advanced solution for alerting homeowners of incoming visitors. 
This system combines the capabilities of both the Ultrasonic Sensor and the piezo buzzer to create a reliable and efficient door monitoring system. 
With its easy setup and customizable code, this system is a great choice for anyone looking to improve their home security
